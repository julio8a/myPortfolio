            <p>Esri builds the leading mapping and spatial analytics software for desktop, software as a service (SaaS), and enterprise applications. Esri ArcGIS products are designed to deliver location intelligence and meet digital transformation needs for organizations of all sizes. This projects focuses on the redesign of the product logos</p>

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Some product owners were requesting a redesign of the product logos, stating they were outdated and had an old look. This spun up the project to revisit the product and create a system</li>
            <li>There was misusage of the current logos since they only came in the hexagon shape. Some product teams were taking the symbol and using a stand-alone or placing other icons inside hexagons, which created confusion as to what was a product logo</li>
            <li>There were no guides as to how to use the logos and what variation can be used depending on context</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Process, people, workflow</h2>
        <p>The approach to re-designing 40+ product logo's is an enormous endeavor. Therefore, the process, people and workflow were built into a program which I designed to move projects fast, efficient and effective through the design and implementation process. I called this, program process program model, which aids in quickly setting a frame around large and small-scale projects to work effectively. To learn the full details of the program process model check out my blog post. The majority of the projects I work on are run through programs. Hence my job title, design program manager. Here is the program process model for this specific project:</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>This phase of the program involved competitive research, market, and internal customer research. However, internal customer research has the most weight as our internal branding and identity is what should be represented in our products. Therefore, we conducted a survey including CTOs, product managers and product owners across the company. There were 90 participants with 28 completions (31.1% completion rate) and 62 partials. </p>
        <p>Before the survey, we were unsure of the scope of the product logo work. It could have been a full redesign or just an update, which is why the research phase proved to be so valuable in this project.</p>
        <p>I won't go into the full details of all the three areas of focus for research on this post. Here is the summary output of what came from competitive research, market research and internal customer research:</p>
        <h3>Survey Findings:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust or remove background treatment (affects 3)</li>
            <li>Groupings of icons by product family</li>
            <li>Symbols are thought to be a bit too chunky (icon line weight)</li>
            <li>Hexagon background is asymmetric and causes implementation problems</li>
            <li>Too much overlapping color usage</li>
            <li>Be clear on differences between desktop/mobile use cases</li>
            <li>Stakeholders would like to see SVG assets in a downloadable location</li>
            <li>If we provide a location it needs to also have clear usage guidelines</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Overall suggestion: focus on the symbol treatment. Minimize the background details.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Current usage context findings:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Inconsistent size and legibility (needs 8)</li>
            <li>Usage both with/without a container, need standalone glyphs</li>
            <li>Sometimes icons are being used as part of an apps splash screens</li>
            <li>Need proper messaging of usage guidelines that can be easily understood</li>
            <li>Having a standalone glyph that can reduce down to one color has been extremely useful as a secondary expression of the logo.</li>
            <li>Needs to fit in: Circle, Square, and various Squircles.</li>
            <li>Needs to work at 16px-1024px</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>Esri's logo design system brings clarity and focuses to ensure our products are impactful and clear. This system was developed to provide specification and usage guidelines to product and marketing teams. The logo system provides robust variations to fit different contextual and situational needs.</p>
        <h3>The foundation</h3>
        <p>First, the container (hexagon). Second, the symbol, representing the product. The container has one variable attribute, the color, which is related to and representative of the product. The symbol and color are two items that are dependent on the product and its story. Below is the relationship between the container and the product symbol. The container is a representation of ArcGIS.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Variants</h2>
        <p>A feature of the logo system is the variance in options. The four logo variations below offer a good range of flexibility to meet different use cases. The story of the logo options below should be used in the context of the Esri brand. The most branded variation is on the left and the least branded in on the right. Which logo to use should be based on questions like, “How much branding does the logo need to portray in its context?”, “What platform are we operating in?”, “What’s the purpose of displaying the logo in this context?”, etc.</p>

            <div class="capture">
                <img src="projects/product-logos/images/image_6.jpg">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Primary expression</h3>
        <p>Meant for marketing efforts such as product pages, marketing websites, marketing apps, etc. A good reference to keep in mind when choosing to use the primary expression is, “Will these be seen by people viewing our software for the first time or who are being introduced to our products?”.</p>
        <h3>Flat</h3>
        <p>The flat variation still contains the unique hexagon branding. However, the background textures are removed since this variation is not used specifically for first-time viewers of Esri’s products. The further we go into an app or page (or the logo system itself), the less branding there should be. This variation can be used on a sign in or splash screens, for example.</p>
        <h3>Glyph</h3>
        <p>At this stage, the uniqueness of this variation is the glyph itself representing the product story. Therefore, it has no hexagon nor hexagon background texture. These glyphs can be used on the product switcher, a page where repetitive products are shown or in a navigation. Use the Glyph to avoid the repetitiveness of the hexagon shape and texture when multiple logos are displayed on a grid for example.</p>
        <h3>Meridian</h3>
        <p>The Meridian style is for highly stylistic representation of products. The recommended usage is tertiary or quaternary actions for the logo. Usage of Meridian logos should also be used at a larger scale due to the thin line weight.</p>
