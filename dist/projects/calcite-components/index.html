            <h1>Calcite Components</h1>
            <p>Calcite Components is a web component library built on Stencil JS and a foundation piece to the Calcite Design System.</p>
            <p class="lien">
                <a href="https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components" target="_blank">
                    Calcite Components GitHub repository
                </a>

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Old framework that didn't support single page applications, <a href="https://github.com/Esri/calcite-web">Calcite-Web</a> (now deprecated).</li>
            <li>Calcite-Web was mainly used as a CSS framework. Therefore, for complex components such as sliders, date-picker, color-picker, etc. There was no unified solution or component.</li>
            <li>There was no JS framework agnostic solution. Teams were creating their own react, ember, vue, angular, components and were not built to share.</li>
            <li>There was no centralized location for sharable, components.</li>
            <li>High development cost due to teams rebuilding components each time they are needed (siloed teams)</li>
            <li>Inconsistent family of products (UX/UI pattern inconsistency) since teams were always trying to reinvent the wheel.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Goals for Calcite Components</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Configurable and easy to compnents</li>
            <li>A consistent system of components</li>
            <li>Open source building and collaboration</li>
            <li>Variance and flexibility within a component. Use props to change theme, color, size, spacing, etc.</li>
            <li>(Sketch, XD, Figma) Libraries for designers to quickly mock-up. 100% parity to calcite-components repository</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Component Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>We have an open and transparent process on GitHub.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="projects/calcite-components/images/image_1.jpg" />
        <br>
        <br>

        <p><b>There are two crucial pieces that made Calcite Components a great success from this life cycle:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the assignment, a design system team member always reviews (or creates) the requested component. We also make sure it stays withing the current system. Consistent hover, active, focus, font size, font weight, etc.</li>
            <li>The implementation can be done by the requestor (We have documentation on consistent API nomenclature and component structures so that new things are consistent regardless of who builds it. Core team can build it, or any other contributing member.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>How we build</h2>
        <p>principles > foundations > components</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="projects/calcite-components/images/image_2.jpg" />
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Design Libraries</h2>
        <p>We currently have the web components build out as a Sketch library. We will be working on adding an XD and Figma library later this year.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="projects/calcite-components/images/image_3.jpg" />
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>From this image you can see other of the project on my portfolio:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Calcite UI Icons</li>
            <li>Esri Product Logos</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are part of the overall foundation of Calcite. In total there is Color, Icons, Typography, and Base. In the future, I'll add the base, color, and typography libraries to my portolio.</p>


        <h2>What comes out of the box with Calcite Components (code and design)?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>All components pass accessibility compliance</li>
            <li>Right to Left support (RTL, i.e. Arabic)</li>
            <li>Internationalization (i.e. date picker displays date order based on location, 25/12/2020)</li>
            <li>Light and Dark theme</li>
            <li>We leverage shadow dom, so anybody using our components won't have any style clashes</li>
            <li>Exposed CSS variables for theming</li>
            <li>Framework agnostic. Doesn't matter what JS Framework you're using, you can easily consume these compnents (ember, angular, react, etc)</li>
            <li>Flexible through props and compnents can be sized. i.e. size="s,m,l,etc"</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Variants</h2>
        <p><b>some examples - all components are highly configurable. In total, the components have over 1,400 permutations.</b></p>
